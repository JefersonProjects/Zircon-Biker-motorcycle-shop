## ‚ú® Core Features

The platform is divided into two main areas to meet the different needs of our customers:

### **1. Motorcycle Catalog**
Our crown jewel. Users can browse an extensive catalog of motorcycles, filtered by brands and categories (sport, urban, dual-sport, etc.).

* **Detailed View:** Each motorcycle has its own page with technical specifications, an image gallery, and a description.
* **Special Acquisition Process:** We understand that buying a motorcycle is a significant decision. Therefore, instead of a direct purchase, we offer:
    * **WhatsApp Assistance:** Direct contact buttons for an advisor to answer all your questions.
    * **Financing Plans:** Forms to request information about personalized financing options.

### **2. Accessories Shop**
Gear up for the road with everything you need. This section functions as a traditional e-commerce store.

* **Product Catalog:** Sale of helmets, gloves, jackets, and more.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users can add multiple accessories to their cart, view their order summary, and modify quantities.
* **Direct Purchase Process:** A simulated checkout process to finalize the purchase of accessories.

## üöÄ Local Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the project on your own computer:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Have **XAMPP** installed on your system (it includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JefersonProjects/Zircon-Biker-motorcycle-shop.git
    ```

3.  **Move the Project to `htdocs`:**
    * Copy the entire project folder and paste it inside the `htdocs` folder located in your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

4.  **Start XAMPP Services:**
    * Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

5.  **Set Up the Database:**
    * Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
    * Create a new database. It is recommended to use a name like `zircon_biker_db`.
    * Select the database you just created and go to the **"Import"** tab.
    * Upload the `.sql` file found in the project folder (e.g., `database/schema.sql`) to create all the necessary tables and records.
    * **Important:** Make sure the database connection credentials in your PHP files (e.g., `config/db.php`) match your MySQL setup (by default, the user is `root` and the password is empty in XAMPP).

6.  **Ready to Ride!**
    * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder_name/`.
    * You should now be able to see the website up and running!
